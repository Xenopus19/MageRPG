Thanks for picking up this Earth Mage pack. 

If you would like to scale the character please use the global move group one step above the root.

I've included specular and emmisive maps incase you don't want to use diffuse only.

The included character fbx has two different staffs, one is just a .obj which you can pin to the hand bone or there is another skinned mesh staff which would allow
for portions of the staff to be animated. eg. the circle section can rotate in multiple axis while the glowing FX stays in the centre.

I will consider making a few basic animation if this pack does remotely well.

For any support or comments please email me at AllanMacDonald.Contact@Gmail.com

I have tested many of the animations from Mixamo's free magic pack and many of them work with the current model however the shoulder armour interferes that has raised arms. I will update this character
in the future to have an option for the shoulder armour to be pinned like the other staff. That was you can just turn it off / not use it if you so choose.
